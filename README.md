# Unix-Test
Final Unix assessment at my university


Task 1:
-Write a command (pipeline), which removes HTML tags from a text file
Task 2:
-Write a command (pipeline) that would split the text file into blocks consisting of 60-75 characters (do not divide words)!
Task 3:
-Use the above commands to write a script, whose input would be a (possibly HTML) text file, and would output the text formatted as in 2.
